Random Rectangle Generator
==========================
Description
-----------
This project is an auxiliary for a CS assignment. The idea is to create a list of random rectangles that do not overlap one another.

Demo
----
A live demo of this project can be found [here](http://rectangles.gurjantkalsi.com/).

Technique
----------
Rectangels are randomly generated by repeatedly dividing the canvas into two (roughly equal sized) segments and recursing on each of the two subsegments. On each recursive call the algorithm will either place a rectangle within the segment or divide the subsegment and recurse on both halves. Since these subsegments cannot overlap, the resulting rectangles will never overlap.
